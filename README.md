MyHome
==========

A simple desktop program to manage finances. Now it functions using a dark theme and simplifying some of the UI to make it look more modern.
The dropdown menu has been updated. instead of a dropdown it will switch between the same dropdown items but on a horizontal bar instead. This feature is similar to how Word works.
Mainly worked in the MenuMDIUI.cs to change the UI and the core finnance functionality has not been changed.
